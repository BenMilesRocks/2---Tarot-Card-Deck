# Tarot Card Deck

![Tarot Card Deck homepage](/assets/documentation/pages/main-page.png)

## Project Goals

This project is to create an interactive tarot card deck, allowing users to perform a basic tarot card reading online without the need for a physical deck of cards.

[The deployed version of the site is available here](https://benmilesrocks.github.io/2---Tarot-Card-Deck/)

The main priority is to make a site that is easy to use. Buttons should be clearly labled, intuitive and easily readable on a wide range of devices.

It should respond quickly and intuitively to user input, with clear feedback for the user to make sure they know when a function is being performed.

The site should also contain links to external resources, allowing the user to learn more about Tarot Card readings at their convenience.

## Design

### Color Scheme

### Typography

### Imagery

Imagery plays a huge part in Tarot, as interpreting the images of the cards is a key factor in how many people perform readings.

I decided to use the classic [Rider-Waite Tarot Card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) for the cards, primarily because it is the most easily identifiable 
of the Tarot Card decks. This makes it simple for newer users and intuitive for people more familiar with Tarot Cards, and improves the overall usability of the site.

For the rest of the site I wanted to keep a clean aesthetic, to keep from making the site layout too cluttered or difficult to understand. To this end I kept most of the Bootstrap's 
'Light' class settings, which provided an unobtrusive User Interface allowing the focus to remain on the cards in play.

During user testing one piece of feedback I received was the desire for a bacground that worked well with the mystical themes of Tarot. I settled on this bacground image of stars, which 
works well with the mystical themes whilst not being too obtrusive or distracting for the user.
